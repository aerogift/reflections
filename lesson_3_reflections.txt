When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

 	When I work with several people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	With manually pull, we will have an opportunity to choose either continue on local or get update from GitHub.
